INSTRUCTIONS:

*** BEFORE DEPLOYING, PLEASE EDIT THE FILE 'site_url.php' UNDER THE 'myworld' directory BY SETTING THE VALUE OF '$base_url'
to the live web site url (e.g "http://dev.coders4africa.org/un/partnersportal") **

THE 'myworld' DIRECTORY MUST BE PLACED UNDER THE 'themes' DIRECTORY OF THE LIVE WORDPRESS WEBSITE ('wp-content/themes').
ONCE THE THEME ACTIVATED FROM THE WORDPRESS ADMIN PANEL (admin panel --> appearance -->themes),   IMPORT THE PAGES (admin panel -> tools -->import) USING the 'partnersportal.wordpress.xxxx-xxx-xx.xml' file.
**NOTE**: Make sure to check that the variable $data_set_page_link in site_url.php points the the correct site as it should be updated soon.

That's it!
