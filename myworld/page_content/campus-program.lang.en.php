Thank you for your interest in supporting <span class="highlight-extra-pages">MY World - the United Nations global survey for a better world.</span> 
<br><br>
From now until 2015, we want as many people in as many countries as possible to be involved with MY World: 
<span class="highlight-extra-pages">citizens of all ages, genders and backgrounds.</span>
<br><br>
The support of a variety of <span class="highlight-extra-pages">groups and individuals</span> is vital in reaching out directly into communities and drawing the digitally 
disconnected, illiterate and poorest communities into the global debate. 
<br><br>
We're currently working on a special partnership program for schools and universities - watch this space!
<br><br>
In the mean time, you can use the tools available on the <a id="" class="dlink" href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>/resources/">'Resources'</a> page to get started.
