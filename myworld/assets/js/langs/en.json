It will complement other initiatives bringing citizens voices into the post-2015 debate, such as the <span class='pages-italics'>‘Participate’</span> project, run by the Institute for Development Studies and the Beyond 2015 coalition of civil society organisations, which is doing in-depth qualitative research into people’s priorities, and the large number of national and thematic consultations organised by the United Nations across the world.<br/><br/>MY World complements these by providing quantitative data on priorities. The options in the survey are deliberately framed in a broad way: <span class='pages-italics'>‘better healthcare’</span> for example, or <span class='pages-italics'>‘equality between men and women’</span> to make these issues understandable to ordinary citizens. The other consultations will be complementary and provide additional information to allow policy makers to understand people’s views and priorities within each of these broad headings, and to consider if and how these could be translated into goals, targets and indicators.<br/><br/>MY World provides a bridge between the other consultation processes, and the political process focusing on how to prioritise to create a manageable global agenda. MY World will allow the views of citizens to be included into that.<br/><br/>The intention is not to create a definite ‘answer’ as to what the world’s priorities should be , but to contribute information to global decision makers to ensure that what emerges at the end of the post 2015 process is informed by the views of as many people as possible.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>Why these 16 options?</h2><br/>Choosing a list of options for a proposal like this is a very difficult task. This is the process we went through to choose the 16 options:<br/><ol class='ordered-list-extra-pages'><li>An initial list of 24 top-line options and explanatory paragraphs was drawn up based on the current Millennium Development Goals issues, a review of civil society and other proposals for post-2015, various Sustainable Development Goals proposals, and existing data from participatory research and polling. The options chosen were those which emerged as clear themes from these sources, and which were likely issues for global.</li><li>This list then went out for consultation, among a group of individuals from NGOs, policy makers, academics and UN staff in a large number of countries and regions. Following the feedback, it was decided to reduce the list to 15, in order to make the survey simpler and more accessible. This list then went out for a second round of consultations among a smaller group, including an Africa-based opinion polling company, for a second round.<li>Following this consultation, it was decided to increase the number to 16 to accommodate the new round of comments.</li><li>A final test was conducted through an SMS survey in Uganda, where an open question was asked and the responses coded back to the 16 options. When asked about issues of most importance to individuals and their families, less than four per cent of responses did not fall under the 16 options categories.</li></ol>We firmly believe that we have a balanced set of options, which reflect the range of issues which people around the world are concerned about and issues around which new goals might be developed. It doesn’t include everything that matters to people, but it does include the range of issues that goals could address and which we know are important to people, to organisations, and to governments. The introduction to the survey, both online and offline, will stress that all of these options are important but that we are trying to identify those that matter most, to inform the eventual selection of a few global goals.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>But what if I want to choose a different option?</h2><br/>The survey provides an opportunity for participants to enter their own priority, through a 17<span class='sup-replacement'>th</span> <span class='pages-italics'>‘your own option’ </span> choice. Answer provided here will analysed very carefully to see if there are missing themes or new ideas that are generating support. The analysis of these free-form options will be made available.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>Why are the options worded like this?</h2><br/>The options have to be understandable to everyone everywhere, not just development experts. We worked with an Africa-based polling company and with communications experts in three organizations to revise the language to ensure that it is accessible and as free as possible of jargon or culturally specific references.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>Why have you asked ‘what matters most to you and your family’?</h2><br/>While a post-2015 agreement will be a global one, ultimately its purpose is to make life better for people. So asking what is important to people seems a better and clearer starting point than asking people to imagine a remote global agreement and what should be in it. The survey is framed around individual priorities, but we recognise that for many people their personal interests and choices are inextricably linked to those of their families (parents, for example, might answer the question with their aspirations for their children in mind). We have therefore tried to get across the idea that while we are asking people what matters to them as individuals, we recognise that their happiness is bound up with that of others.<br/><br/>In addition, wording the question like this means that there is less room for respondents to interpret the question differently, which is a risk if we asked a broader question on the priorities for global governance, or one about country or community priorities.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>Why limit people to 16 options …couldn’t you just ask an open question?</h2><br/>MY World is just one part of a global consultation effort on post-2015, and all the others involve open questions. There are lots of ways for people to put forward their points of view, and these different methods can complement each other. The role of MY World is to offer insights about people’s priorities, and for that it was necessary to predetermine the list of options. As described above, great efforts have been made to ensure that the priorities are representative of the things people have said are important .<br/><br/>In addition, there are two technical and methodological reasons for asking closed questions:<br/><ul class='list-extra-pages'><li>Given that the survey is going to be done in multiple languages, and through different mediums (web, SMS and offline), current technology is not good enough for the responses to an open question to be grouped consistently and credibly into clusters for analysis using available software. Manual coding of the several million responses we are hoping for in this project would make the project prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.</li><li>Major polling partners have shared their experience that participation rates are very significantly lower in surveys with open questions. This is not surprising as they require more thought and effort from the participants. Therefore, in order to maximise participation and make the survey as accessible as possible, offering closed options is a better solution.</li></ul><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>But you can’t really tackle poverty through a list of single issues – everything is connected.</h2><br/>We agree. That’s why it was important to give people a large number of options and to allow them to choose more than one. Choosing 6 out of the 16 will allow people to think about what combinations of actions might produce the best effect. It will also allow people to select options which tackle the same problem in different ways: a parent concerned that their daughter should get a good education, for example, might want to choose both ‘equality between men and women’ and ‘a good education’ to represent the different dimensions of the changes they want to see.<br/><br/>We tested the poll with three pilot groups to see whether it made a difference if people were asked to choose 3, 5, or 7 options. Respondents were asked whether the survey was harder/easier and more or less enjoyable. No noticeable differences were found.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>How will you know if people answering the survey are representative of the population as a whole or of different groups within it?</h2><br/>We are going to find out as much as we can about the people answering the survey, so we can say as much as possible about whom they are. But we will be extremely careful not to over-claim, by being open and transparent about the content and limitations of the data. In addition, we are taking advice from a global expert opinion polling company about how to analyse and present the data. The levels of information are as follows:<br/><ul class='list-extra-pages'><li> Gender – all respondents will be asked their gender so this applies to all data</li><li> Age – again, all respondents</li><li> Country – all respondents</li><li> Method of response – we will be able to analyse the data according to how people take the survey, which will establish any broad differences between the three groups.</li><li> Date and time of response – to evaluate the impact of any marketing campaigns and to pick up any automated programmes that could rig the results.</li><li> Educational level – all off-line and SMS participants will be asked this question. In addition, all online participants will be asked this question as an optional extra (this is to minimise the dropout rate)</li><li> Sub-national region – we will have this information about SMS participants from the mobile operators, and about offline participants from the surveyors. Online participants will again be asked this question as an optional extra, to minimise dropout rates.</li></ul>The information we will collect will be of a similar level of detail to that collected by the Gallup World Survey and other globally representative samples. While we will not be randomly sampling in the way that Gallup does, we will use the social and demographic data we collect to establish how well our sample in each country reflects its whole population, and make that clear when we publish the data.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>How will you present the data?</h2><br/>It will be possible to view the data from the web survey in real time, and data from the SMS and offline surveys will also be added as rapidly as possible to ensure the results are up to date.<br/><br/>In addition, the extra information collected from people taking the survey will be used to disaggregate the data to provide a picture of how priorities differ between countries, demographic and socio-economic groups. We will report on the priorities of different groups and countries separately.<br/><br/>We will also aggregate the results by country, region and globally. In doing so, we will use the information collected from participants to weight the responses so that when data is aggregated, it is done so in a way that provides as representative a picture as possible of the whole population. Options for weighting include:<br/><ul class='list-extra-pages'><li> <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>Demographic factors:</span> weighting the responses from each country in line with population size, from men and women and different age groups to reflect the balance in the population.</li><li> <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>Socio-economic factors and sub-national regional demographics.</span> We expect to have information about level of education and sub-national region of residence for a sizeable sub-group of the total respondents. Once the numbers are large enough it will therefore be possible to weight responses in a way that reflects the socioeconomic as well as demographic composition of countries.</li><li> <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>Proxies for income:</span> to some extent the three response methods are proxies for different income groups, with the wealthiest being more likely to have access to the web and the poorest most likely to be among those participating offline. This is particularly the case given that the focus for the offline survey will be the poorest regions in the different countries in which it is administered. We will experiment with different ways of weighting the responses according to how the survey was carried out, to reflect regional population patterns and the distribution of income groups within countries.</li></ul><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>If the post-2015 agenda is about eradicating poverty…why should we care about the priorities of people who aren’t poor?</h2><br/>We have taken great care in developing the methodology to ensure that the priorities of the poorest people are captured in this survey, and that it will be possible to analyse their responses separately from the rest. We have used household survey data to identify the regions within countries where the poorest people live, and will be focusing the off-line efforts in those regions to ensure coverage of the poorest communities. In addition, we are planning to work with a group of NGOs who can give us advice on how to do the survey with specific hard-to-reach groups such as children, older people and disabled people, and many of those same NGOs will do the survey with the communities they work with. So it will be possible to use this data to focus only on the extremely poor, if that is the focus. When the data is aggregated at the global level, we can use weighting techniques to ensure that the responses of poor people count in proportion to their numbers in the whole population, and are not drowned out by a large web response in high income countries.<br/><br/>But the survey is designed to be global because everyone has aspirations and faces problems in their lives. And very often the priorities of different groups are more similar than we might expect. Understanding how people in every country view their lives and the things they would like to change will make it easier tobuild the political constituencies to push for a new agreement. The more a framework reflects a global consensus about priorities, the easier it will be to build the politics that can make it happen.<br/><br/><br/><h2 class='methodology-header'>Isn’t there a bit more to a new framework than just short-listing the most important issues to people round the world?</h2><br/>The MY World survey is just one of a whole range of consultations and political processes that will contribute to a new agreement. And knowing about priorities for different groups will be important in shaping those politics.<br/><br/>In framing the 16 options, we were very aware that this process is about designing global goals, so the options all represent issues that could usefully and feasibly be tackled through international action. We excluded some things, like, for example, religion, which we know are very important to people but which would be less appropriate as subjects for new global goals.",

The sixteen issues have been built up following an <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>extensive analysis and consultation exercise:</span><br/><br/><ul class='list-extra-pages'><li>The survey was designed as an <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>options survey</span>, rather than an ‘open question’ survey because MY World’s particular purpose within the UN’s wider global consultation effort about post-2015 is to offer <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>insights about people’s priorities.</span> </li> <li><span class='highlight-extra-pages'>An initial list of twenty four issues was drawn up from a variety of important sources</span>, including participatory research, polling, civil society inputs , the Millennium Development Goals and plans for Sustainable Development Goals.  The options were then refined to sixteen choices through <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>numerous rounds of consultations</span>,  with NGOs, policy makers, academics, UN staff and expert opinion polling companies.  The survey has also <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>been tested on pilot groups</span>,  and through an SMS survey in Uganda to ensure that the sixteen options are comprehensive and appropriate. </li> <li>To capture any recurring themes which may have been missed, participants can also enter their own priority through an additional ‘add your own option’ choice. </li>  <li>The MY World survey cannot cover everything that is important to citizens because not all problems can be tackled through global goals.  However, the range of priorities that goals could address and which we know are important to people, have been included. </li> </ul>    <span class='highlight-extra-pages'>The MY World survey can be accessed through THREE main channels:</span><br/><br/><ul class='list-extra-pages'><li><span class='highlight-extra-pages'>Online:</span> at <span class='highlight-extra-pages'><a href='http://www.myworld2015.org/' target='_blank' class='links-extra-pages'>www.myworld2015.org</a></span> in the six UN official languages and through social media; </li><li><span class='highlight-extra-pages'>Mobile phone technologies <span class='highlight-underline-extra-pages'> (available from January 2013)</span>:</span> via SMS and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) through toll-free phone numbers; and </li><li><span class='highlight-extra-pages'>Offline <span class='highlight-underline-extra-pages'>(available from December 2012):</span></span> in paper form by way of a ballot – distributed through a network of grass roots organizations, faith communities, youth groups, private sector bodies and NGO partners around the world. </li></ul>   The survey is anonymous.
